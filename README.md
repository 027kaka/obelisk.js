# Obelisk.js

Obelisk.js is an open source JavaScript engine to build pixel isometric objects.

With this engine, you can easily add isometric pixel element like brick, cube, pyramid onto the canvas.

It is isometric graphic based, but not designed as an game engine. Just dive into it and try to pixelate something.
